# Whack-a-mole
it is a simple game where the player will just have to click on the box on which mole appears and player will get point if he is able to click before the mole 
moves to different mole.
There is a time limit and the final score will be the number of times a player is able to click the mole in the given time.
It's fun to play.

Try and see how much you can score!
